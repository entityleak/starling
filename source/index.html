				<h5>There were jewels made from gold encrusted with fragments of glass from the shattered windscreens of shootouts between rival drug lords. Apparently the soft tar streets in border towns of northern Mexico glint and sparkle in the sun with all the shattered glass. I don’t remember seeing these gold and glass jewels in the Rota Ivancich Palace close to San Marco square, Venezia. It was summer 2009. I was working at the New Zealand pavilions during the Venice biennale. On my days off I would visit the pavilions of other countries. A flag dyed with blood hung outside the entrance to the palace. This flag stood in place of the Mexican flag. Over six thousand people were killed as a result of drug violence in 2009. Some people die; some people are killed. Some people know this like the way shootout glass knows tar: in an everyday kind of way. Other people expect death to occur peacefully after a full life. Teresa Margolles dyed the flag with the blood of people who were killed. The people had been shot or decapitated. Deadheaded. There was enough blood at the sites of execution to cover the walls of the palace with blood-dyed canvases. I remember these, but dimly. Teresa put the blood she collected to other uses. Impossible to forget. Each day the palazzo floors were mopped slowly with traces of the victims’ blood. It was a relative of the victim who mopped the opulent floors. Five months of mopping blood. Over the course of the biennale the palazzo floor became sticky. Over the course of America’s War on Drugs violence has proliferated in Colombia and Mexico. America has legalised AK-47s, but not marijuana. America’s illegal gun trade with Mexico is booming. A man with orange skin wants to build a giant wall between the two countries. Teresa took bloodstained textiles to the American pavilion in Venice to cover up the windows.</h5>

			<article class='accordion hide'><div class='wrap'><div class='content'>
				<h5>I remember the first time I realised that there is no new water. We all crawled out of the ocean. When I googled “what percentage of the world is [water]” (71%) the top search result was “what percentage of the world is [gay].” (The controversial 10% seems to hold.) Statistics are often hamstrung. Boundaries blur. The motility and mobility of air, water, microbes (the kingdoms of life) and toxic chemicals (the kingdoms of unlife) facilitate perceptions of porosity. The breathing of trees and humans is one such symbiotic relation: trees breathe in carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen while humans breath in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Trees of course could easily survive without humans. But many trees require the mycorrhizal symbiosis of fungi to thrive. A strip of plantation trees is not a forest; it is a plantation. Plantations are susceptible to dis-ease because they are of a kind. And of one kind cannot respond to multiple and different visitations or invasions. Fungi and trees dialogue all day long (I don’t know if they sleep). Fungi go on burrowing missions to extract the best nutrition for the trees’ roots. Trees send them sweet living juices. A mushroom circle in bloom is not necessarily a sign of healthy pro-reproduction. This is the fungi rising to the earth’s surface in desperation to produce spores because someone cut down their other half. A mushroom circle is a sign of mourning. Like those photographs of dead birds with their innards full of bright pieces of plastic they thought was food. Like flame retardant chemicals known as&nbsp;HBCDs showing up in Antarctica, or the damage done by tourists in search of the Patagonian toothfish. In search of toothy freedom. A forest takes a long time to grow. The relations are complex. I try to love Pinus radiata. Even if it is not totara, rimu, kauri. We still breathe together.</h5>

<p>Blood is precise when measured. A sonnet has fourteen lines of four stanzas. <em>Blood Sonnets</em> (2000) by Juliana Spahr is a sequence of four fourteen-line stanzas. The subject is blood and all of us as an intricate system. This is a typical line:</p>

<p><strong>mean platelet volume at 7.8 fluid liquid The catalogue of force and animal life</strong></p>

<p><em>Sonnet</em> is made from Spahr’s <em>Blood Sonnets</em>. <em>Sonnet</em> has been made with the precision of blood and the precision of sonnet. There are fourteen screens.</p>

<p>To generate the word plasma of <em>Sonnet</em>, I took every fourteenth word from <em>Blood Sonnets</em>. I did this four times in four different ways: beginning to end, end to beginning, centre right beginning to end, and centre left end to beginning. Then I chose four words—one each from each of the stanzas. This gave me a total of 237 words. Fourteen screens divided by 237 words equals 16.92857142857143 words per screen. (Word count varies between screens.)</p>
